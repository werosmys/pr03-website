        <h2>Creating the Magazine Spread</h2>
          <p>My magazine project was a bit of a challenge to get right. I had a vision for the cover that I think I executed well, and I believe my opening and story spreads have a consistent carried theme between them. A lot of the struggles I had with this project were actually in getting the alternative story form page right, and I eventually just had to go with what I had due to the deadline drawing near.</p>
          <p>To start with the cover, my vision with picking that specific image was with how the negative space subtly mimicked the line-work in the Tube Map, which was the main focus of the story. Keeping in mind the fictional magazine’s audience of designers, I decided to keep the cover relatively minimalist and monotone in color. I was very proud of the interlacing numbers, which I consider the highlight of the cover. Originally, I wanted to include a small amount of reefer text, but I couldn’t find a suitable way to implement it, so I decided instead to lean into the minimalist aesthetic.</p>
          <p>For the spreads, I wanted to follow the same minimalist design language while also implementing design strategies that we learned in class. I found a font family that I liked– P22 Underground– which mimics the style of text found on the location signs in the London Underground. To use the colors that I wanted, red, blue and white, I had to desaturate the opening image by a good amount, but I think that actually worked in my favor to draw attention away from the Covent Gardens sign and more toward the large headline text.</p>
          <p>The second spread I struggled with a little, mostly in deciding where to place the elements. I ended up going with a bit of an unconventional design for one of the side-elements, with a massive circle in the center of the text. I made the circle emulate the design of an underground station sign. For the focus of the sidebar, the ‘tube gear,’ I wanted to practice with the pen tool some more, so I went into Photoshop with every image in the folder and cut and pasted them into one file. I then layered each of the images over each other. Later, I went back and altered the layering so that they would fill the space a bit better.</p>
          <p>For the other sidebar, I included and titled some of the old maps. I originally was also modeling that element after the sign as well, but then I decided to run it off the page so that it looked a little more like the metro lines on the map itself. I then decided to echo that idea on the opposite corner of the page by putting in some lines that also looked like metro lines. Both spreads are rather muted, but I think it matches the British character well, and the black-and white nature of the rest of the spread lets the colors of the other elements pop a bit more.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned in the intro, the page I struggled with the most was the alternative story form (ASF) page. I am naturally drawn to more subtle and muted tones, but for this page I wanted something a bit brighter to match the color scheme of the winning album cover, Sgt. Pepper, which was also the biggest element on the page.</p>
          <p>I sort of decided to just use the ASF as a learning exercise in combining everything ever discussed about composition, and I think this is most clearly seen in the placement of each album cover in the ‘Golden Spiral.’ I had a hard time coming up with a background color, so I decided to instead pull inspiration from the main story and use those same colors in more saturated tones. I then decided to add a white drop-‘shadow’ to the 5 to invoke the idea of the British flag, emphasizing that these are all British designs without outright stating it. I had a hard time placing the text, and ended up severely shortening the text I was given to make it fit. I could have made everything smaller, but I ended up coming to like the bold, in-your-face design I came up with. While the ASF is, in my opinion, the weakest part of my project, I still like it and think it has its own merits in a fun, quirky way.</p>
