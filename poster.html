    <h2>Drawing Inspiration from Your Surroundings</h2>
    <p>I went through several iterations of this idea before coming to my final design. I designed a majority of this
      poster while still in Europe, but I ended up actually making it while jet-lagged and recovering from a mysterious
      stomach bug. I don&rsquo;t think the idea I had in my head necessarily translated to the screen, but I still like
      what I ended up with.</p>
    <p>Originally, I wanted my design to mimic the Czech flag, which is white and red with a blue triangle on the left
      side. I kept that basic design throughout my iterations with the poster, which has two sections of Prague
      separated by the river. The landscape and focus of the illustration is the far side of the river, where the castle
      and St. Vitus cathedral can be seen on the right side, and the Charles Bridge tower can be seen in the middle.</p>
    <p>I wanted a simple design, but that was inherently at odds with the subject matter I chose, which was specifically
      to depict a landscape of the city. Originally, I was working to create an illustration with much more detailed
      buildings, which the castle and cathedral are a remnant of. As time progressed I decided to focus more on actually
      getting the project done rather than making minute buildings for 3+ hours at a time. Ultimately I think I made the
      right call in that regard.</p>
    <p>Even with my decision to forgo that sense of realism, I still feel like I captured Prague well enough. The poster
      doesn&rsquo;t completely take me back, but it is definitely reminiscent of the city. The color scheme is very
      accurate, though I took some liberties with the geography and location of buildings. I did so to include both the
      Charles Bridge and the cathedral in a vertical format. Considering these are two of the most famous structures in
      Prague, it felt necessary.</p>
    <p>On the whole, I like what I ended up with. If I had more time to go back to my original idea, I would probably
      lean further into the flag concept, and maybe only include silhouettes instead of full buildings. There is a lot I
      can say in hindsight, but I like my final result for what it is.</p>
