    <h2>How the Exercises Helped me Grow</h2>
    <p>We worked on many smaller exercises and projects over the course of this brief 6-week class. Of everything we
      did, I was the most proud of the three displayed above. All three of these exercises were guided precursors to the
      main project for that unit, and we were encouraged to find our own creative style as we worked through them. More
      than anything, these projects helped me understand the usage of InDesign and Illustrator and just how powerful
      those programs can get. </p>

          Our first major exercise was a magazine spread about toxic waste.

      <h3>Poison! In the Well</h3>
      <p>This magazine spread was a guided exercise, but there are some big ways that I strayed from the original given
        design. I made the headline smaller and stuffed it into the sidebar, which I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have done if I
        were
        to go back and re-do this now. The thing that I was most proud of for this exercise was the hazard stripes
        lining
        the top of the second spread. It took a surprisingly long amount of time to get that just right. </p>
      <p>I probably struggled with the map the most. It was provided to me just a little bit bigger than I wanted to use
        it, and I didn&rsquo;t catch until I was ready to export that the street names had disappeared when I sized it down.
        We
        were provided some more content to go with the map, if I remember correctly, but I had a hard time managing my
        space in this exercise and could barely fit in the sidebars that I used. </p>
      <p>I find it interesting the amount of similarities the second spread shares with the second spread of my final <a
          href="magazine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magazine project</a>. In a way I think I used
        this exercise as a prototype for my magazine project, and you can see some of the ideas I tried here were worked
        on and re-implemented better in the final.</p>

          The exercise I'm most proud of is this poster for a cafe.

      <h3>Beans? Beans.</h3>

      <p>The poster exercise I actually almost didn&rsquo;t do. Well, I was about halfway through it when I got off the plane
        in
        Edinburgh, Scotland, and believe me when I say I was not interested in doing any class work while there. I ended
        up finishing it and turning it in several days after it was due, but I think that doing that instead of trying
        to
        rush it was ultimately better for the design. I took my time when I was ready to work on it and came up with
        something really nice. </p>
      <p>I actually like this poster more than my final poster project, but that&rsquo;s probably because I didn&rsquo;t have to
        figure out where to put everything. The coffee theming helps, although I would have lightened the whole thing
        up,
        looking back on it now. The dark brown coffee tones start to meld together, and I would have liked to use a bit
        more of that blue accent color. </p>

      <h3>Retro-Future Webpage</h3>
      <p>The webpage was the easiest of all of the projects for me. I have taken several classes throughout my time at
        IU
        that have taught me the ins-and-outs of web design, and I have published five buildouts with the IDS which
        include
        a story on <a href="https://specials.idsnews.com/transgender-experience-bloomington/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">transgender health care</a> and parts of the <a
          href="https://specials.idsnews.com/2023-little-500-race-guide/gallery.html" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 Little 500 Guide</a>. All of that is to say that I came into this class with a
        little bit of experience, so I treated this last exercise as something a little bit more fun. </p>
      <p>I wanted to lean into the retro topic and complement the image I was provided, so I stuck to some pretty basic
        design. I found a cool retro color scheme online and did something that I have never done before. I added a
        border
        to the image. I&rsquo;ll admit, I had a little trouble styling the image with the caption next to it, but I got there
        in
        the end, even if the image is still just a little bit too big. </p>
      <p>Overall I learned a lot more about the fundamentals of design in this class than I knew going in. I am excited
        to
        work on these skills in the future, and I hope that this website, my true final project, is a good showcase of
        what I learned in the class.</p>
